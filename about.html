        <p class="pic-text background">My name is <strong>Stephanie Raymos.</strong>
            <br>I started using essential oils in High School when a friend gave me a mixture for a cold.
            <br>After experiencing the benefits within a few hours I decided to do a little research.
            <br>A little research turned into months of dedicated study with books and print outs and highlighters.
            <br>My collection grew over the years entering adulthood and now at 27 years old I have every oil offered by Doterra.
            <br>Anytime anything goes wrong, there's an oil for it. I have yet to find something this doesn't apply to.
            <br>Thank you for reading! I hope this has inspired you to give them a try.</p>
